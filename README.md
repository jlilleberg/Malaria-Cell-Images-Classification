## Motivation

There are a lot of images in the medical field that can benefit from image classifiers and object detection. Moreover, I wanted to learn how to perform an image classification end-to-end project using TensorFlow2.

## Dataset Description

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. The symptoms  range from tiredness, vomitting, and headacches to siezures, comas, and even death. Like any disease, being able to detect if a patient is infected is desireable. The Malaria dataset is a repository of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity. The Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.
